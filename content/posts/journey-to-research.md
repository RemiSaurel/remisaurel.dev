_I discovered research when I reoriented myself after a few years on very different studies. It doesn't have to be a straight line, and reorienting yourself is not a failure._

# Tunnel vision

I've always pretty much liked school. Although I did enjoy some subjects and dislike others, I've always been a kind of "classic" student. Not doing too much but just enough. I didn't have big ambitions, I just wanted to do something I liked and that would allow me to live decently.

## High school

After a few years, I realized that high school wasn't the best period for me. I played football A LOT and wasn't very worried about school: my goal was to become a physiotherapist. Studying for this job in France relies on medical studies: the only condition to be accepted was to have the [Baccalaur√©at](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at_en_France) (which is the most common exam when you finish high school). Which I obtained with low grades.

## Medicine ‚û°Ô∏è Foreign languages ?

After obtaining the "Bac", I did a few months in [PACES](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premi%C3%A8re_ann%C3%A9e_commune_aux_%C3%A9tudes_de_sant%C3%A9) (Premi√®re Ann√©e Commune aux √âtudes de Sant√©, translated as "Common First Year of Medical Studies"). This didn't go well and I realized the requirements to pass the year: study, learn by heart and do not even try to understand (spoiler: it's useless). That wasn't for me at all. After this year, I decided to go to university to study foreign languages. I've always been decent at English and this was my security blanket. I did a year of English and Spanish but realized that it didn't suit me either. After a few searches and an internship where I wrote my first lines of code, I decided to give a try to the ["DUT Informatique"](https://www.iut-rodez.fr/fr/les-formations/but-informatique/but-informatique-presentation) which is a 2-year technical degree in computer science.

## DUT Informatique

These 2 years were a revelation. I discovered a new passion, computer science. I loved learning new things, discovering new stuff everyday and the fact that you can basically create anything you want. I really enjoyed some subjects like databases and web development.\
During DUT, [Franck Silvestre](https://francksilvestre.github.io/) was one of my teacher for databases and project managements. He was the one who introduced me to research and the possibility to do a PhD. I didn't really know what it was but I was curious.\
These 2 years have been marked by COVID-19 and the lockdowns. I was lucky to live at my parents' house, so I was never alone. After obtaining my diploma, I decided to pursue my studies in computer science and I joined the [MIAGE of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse](https://www.miage.fr/toulouse/).

## L3 MIAGE

MIAGE stands for "M√©thodes Informatiques Appliqu√©es √† la Gestion des Entreprises" which can be translated as "Methods of Computer Science Applied to Business Management".\
It is a good mix between computer science and project management. An important aspect to me was also to be able to start my apprenticeship in a company. After a 2 months internship at [R2N, RAGT](https://www.ragt.fr/), I decided to continue one year with them as an apprentice.\
This experience was very enriching and I learned a lot about the professional world. I worked on a variety of projects and I was able to apply what I learned at school. At the end of this year, [Franck](https://francksilvestre.github.io/) contacted me to offer me an apprenticeship in his research team and within a company called [Kosmos](https://kosmos-education.com). I accepted and started my apprenticeship in September 2022.

## Master MIAGE & Apprenticeship

My Master has been a 2 years full of discoveries. I worked a lot on personnal projects and discovered the world of research thanks to the apprenticeship. I joined [TALENT team](https://www.irit.fr/departement/intelligence-collective-interaction/talent/) at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) and worked on [Denis Ollivier thesis](http://www.atief.fr/these/ollivierdenis) about Testing and Spacing effects.\
My main mission was to develop an application to help students to revise. It was really interesting since it was a mix between research and full-stack development. This opportunity led me to my current position: PhD student in the same team.

## PhD opportunity

For the past 2 years, my goal has never changed: I want to do a PhD. Discovering it for 2 years with the environment of Denis' thesis has been the best way to know if I wanted to do it. After several iterations about the subject, administrative stuff and a lot of discussions, I finally started my PhD in November 2024. The subject is yet not officaly translated but a draft of it would be: "Technology-supported regulation of learning: what contributions from generative AI?".\
This is only the beginning of a new adventure and I'm really excited about it.\

See you soon! üëã
