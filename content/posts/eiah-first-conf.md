# Context

EIAH (Environnements Informatiques pour l'Apprentissage Humain) is a conference dedicated to technology-enhanced learning. It was my first conference and I had the opportunity to present my first paper (written with Franck, Jean-Baptiste and Emmanuel), meet many people, and attend interesting talks.

The conference took place in üìå Lille, France, from üìÖ June 10 to 13, 2025.

## Program
The program was rich and varied, with many interesting talks and workshops.
Timeline was as follows:
- **June 10**: Workshops, with a first session on the morning (I attended the one on "Skills & Learning Analytics Dashboards") and a second session in the afternoon (I attended the one on "AI").
- **June 11**: 1st day of paper presentations, where I presented [our paper](https://hal.science/hal-05070808/) on the Responsible Integration of Generative AI in Education. The afternoon was dedicated to posters and demos.
- **June 12**: 2nd day of paper presentations. Jos√© and Luis from our [TALENT team](https://irit.fr/TALENT/site) also presented their paper that had been accepted. The evening was dedicated to a social event with a dinner in the city center.
- **June 13**: Last day of the conference, with a few more paper presentations and a keynote by Engin Bumbacher.


I particularly enjoyed the keynote by :icon-link{icon-name='i-academicons:google-scholar' route='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yu5GSC4AAAAJ&hl=en' external}[Engin Bumbacher] about "The design of pedagogical tools as a mediator between learning theories and teachers". Although the learning theories are still a bit abstract for me, I found the talk very interesting and it gave me some ideas for my future work.

## Our paper

I presented  [our paper](https://hal.science/hal-05070808/) on the Responsible Integration of Generative AI in Education, which was a **position paper**. After identifying 3 trends on GenAI in Education (1. Use of GenAI is increasing, especially on student side; 2. The gap between students and teachers on GenAI use is widening; 3. Students use GenAI in a context not controlled by teachers and not always by their parents.), we proposed an integration of risk management in the design of GenAI tools for education applied to my PhD project on Konsolidation Dashboards (KDo). 

A contribution was also the Enriched Design-Based Research (DBR) (see figure below). This enriched-DBR contribution has been added to next papers. The one I presented at EIAH 2025 was still in an early stage and it was not yet fully integrated.

It was kind of unexpected to have a position paper accepted since we didn't see this type of paper in last years' proceedings. Yet, it was a great opportunity to present our work and get feedback from the community. The presentation went well, and I received some interesting questions and comments.

# Retro

Now, let's talk about the conference experience itself. Although it was my first conference, I felt quite comfortable. I had the opportunity to meet many people, PhD students / postdocs / researchers from different universities and research labs, and I was able to discuss my work with them. 
Networking was a key aspect of the conference, and I was able to exchange ideas and experiences with other researchers from different fields and backgrounds, which was very enriching.

The first day on the workshops was a bit weird, activity-wise. I think I didn't got lucky on the ones I attended since both had some techical issues resulting in delay and not doing the activities as planned. It was still a great introduction to the conference, people and the first discussions.

My paper presentation was on the first day of paper presentations, which was a bit stressful but also very exciting. I didn't prepare a lot for it (we still did 4 or 5 tries before...üòÖ) and it went pretty well.

I appreciated the informal talks and networking aspects of the conference during evening events. It allowed me to meet people in a more relaxed setting and discuss our work in a more informal way. On the networking side, I think I met some people I will keep in touch with since we have similar research interests and collaborations are possible.

The topic of EIAH is inter-disciplinary, and this year was a bit more about social sciences. Although I find it very interesting, there were less technical talks than I expected.

# What's next?
Now, what's next for the next weeks and months?
- Short-term: finishing ECTEL demo paper, KDo development, and focus-groups with teachers üë©‚Äçüè´
- Mid-term: 1st experiment on KDo (planned for September 2025) ü´£

üîú A new blog post will be released soon about the PhD journey with some feedback and lessons learned so far.
