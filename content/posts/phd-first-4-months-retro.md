I was wondering how I could start this post. Maybe a song is worth a thousand words:

<div class="flex items-center justify-center pt-8">
<iframe style="border-radius:12px; height: 100px"  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2t8yVaLvJ0RenpXUIAC52d?utm_source=generator" width="300" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

Yes, I learned a lot. On the PhD itself, on teaching and learning, but also on myself. Let's jump in!

## Reading, reading and rea- writing?

## Teaching experience

## Top 3 of this period

## What's next?
