I was wondering how I could start this post. Maybe a ðŸŽ¶ song ðŸŽ¶ is worth a thousand words:

</div>

Yes, I learned a lot. On the PhD itself, on teaching and learning, but also on myself. Let's jump in!

# Reading, reading and rea- writing?

## Introduction

Although I started to "read" (it was more likely just skimming through articles) scientific papers a few years ago, I've never actually had the opportunity to organize and synthesize my findings effectively. The first weeks of my thesis has been very intense in terms of reading. I think there are a few reasons behind this.

First, my thesis subject Technology-enhanced regulation of learning: what contributions from GenAI? <ProseA href="https://theses.fr/s403597" target="_blank">(see here)</ProseA> is by definition interdisciplinary. It means there are different fields to explore, such as cognitive psychology, educational sciences but also AI and computer science. Second, the Generative AI era is moving **really** fast. Every day, new papers are published on arXiv but also on famous and relevant journals. There are also different papers coming from UNESCO, governments, and other organizations. So, how to keep up with all of this?

## Iterative improvements

Iterative improvements. By testing different methods and refine them, I found a way to be more efficient in my reading process. The goal was to try methods, see what works and what doesn't, and then refine them. Here is what I first did:

1. Identify key papers in the field.
2. Add them in Zotero (using <ProseA href="https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors" target="_blank">this wonderful Zotero browser plugin</ProseA>).
3. Read and annotate them on GoodNotes on my iPad.

Zotero is actually one of my best discoveries of this period. I knew it before, but I never really used it. It's a free and open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials. It's really powerful and I highly recommend it.

After a few weeks, I had a lot of papers in my Zotero library. I then started to tag them. My tags are organised in a way it allows my to prioritize my reading :tag{color="red"}[P1], :tag{color="yellow"}[P2], :tag{color="gray"}[P3] and :tag{color="cyan"}[BONUS]
I also tagged them depending on their status. I have a tag :tag{color="wine"}[FINISHED] for finished papers, and :tag{color="blue"}[CURRENT] to track papers I'm currently reading. Finally, for "important papers" I have 2 tags: :tag{color="lime"}[C>100] for papers with more than 100 citations and :tag{color="grass"}[C++] (you got it?) for "important" papers in their
field.

I also started to directly annotate through Zotero from my laptop. Their annotation tool is really good and allows me to highlight (with a specific color code) with less friction than GoodNotes.

Zotero is synced and I can access my library from any device. It's really convenient to read from my iPad or quickly search for a paper on my phone.

After a few weeks of reading papers, we had the opportunity to write a first paper based on our findings.

::blockquote{type="important"}
Due to anonymity reasons, I can't share or talk about the content of the paper. It'll be the subject for another post ðŸ¤“. I'll still share the main difficulties I had during this exercice and how I dealt with it.
