# Focus

## Deep Work in Research

- **Uninterrupted research sessions**: How I learned to carve out 4-6 hour blocks for deep thinking
- **Managing academic distractions**: Dealing with conferences, papers, and the constant stream of "interesting" research
- **The art of saying no**: Turning down opportunities to maintain focus on core research questions

## Finding My Research North Star

- **Defining clear research questions**: The evolution from broad interests to specific, actionable problems
- **Balancing exploration vs exploitation**: When to dive deep vs when to explore new territories
- **Creating rituals**: Morning routines, workspace setup, and mental preparation techniques

## Focus vs Flexibility

- **Planned pivots**: How focused doesn't mean rigid - adapting research direction based on findings
- **Collaborator influence**: Incorporating feedback while maintaining research integrity

# Create

The second pillar of my PhD experience has been about creation - not just consuming research, but actively building, prototyping, and bringing ideas to life. This "bias toward action" has been transformative.

## Building to Think

- **Prototype-driven research**: How building helped me understand theoretical concepts
- **The maker mindset in academia**: Applying startup principles to research projects
- **Tools and platforms built**: [List specific projects you worked on]

## From Idea to Implementation

- **Version control for research**: How I track iterations of ideas and prototypes
- **Sharing early and often**: The courage to show unfinished work to get feedback

## Digital Garden Growing

- **This blog as creation**: How writing became a tool for thinking and sharing
- **Visual thinking**: Creating diagrams, sketches, and visual representations of complex ideas

# Fail

## The Courage to Fail Fast

- **Hypothesis graveyard**: A collection of ideas that didn't work and why
- **Experimental failures**: When prototypes crashed, burned, or simply didn't work as expected
- **Paper rejections**: How I learned to see rejections as redirection, not defeat

## Failure as Data

- **Documenting what doesn't work**: Creating a "failure log" to track patterns
- **Sharing failures openly**: Contributing to the research community by documenting dead ends

## Reframing Failure

- **From perfectionist to iterationist**: How I learned to ship "good enough" and improve
- **The compound effect of small failures**: How tiny setbacks led to major breakthroughs

# Learn

The meta-skill that ties everything together is learning - not just domain knowledge, but learning how to learn, how to think, and how to grow as a researcher and person.

## Adaptive Learning Systems

- **Personal knowledge management**: Building a system to capture, connect, and retrieve insights
- **Feedback loops**: Creating mechanisms to get regular input on my work and thinking
- **Cross-pollination**: Learning from fields outside my direct research area
- **Pattern recognition**: Developing the ability to see connections across different domains

## Future Learning Trajectory

- **Research skill gaps**: Areas I've identified for focused improvement in year two
- **Intellectual curiosity cultivation**: Maintaining wonder and openness to surprise

## The Compound Effect

Looking back on this first year, I see how Focus, Create, Fail, and Learn aren't separate phases but interconnected loops. Each failure focused my attention. Each creation led to new learning. Each moment of focus enabled better creation.

The PhD isn't just about becoming an expert in a narrow field - it's about becoming an expert learner, creator, and systematic thinker. The research is the vehicle, but the journey is the destination.
